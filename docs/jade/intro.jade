          p.card-text
            | Nowadays, we spend about 70%-90% time indoors. Indoor air pollution causes an estimated 3.8 million deaths worldwide a year, according to a World Health Organisation report.

            | The most common pollutant in indoor air. Emitted from walls, floors, furniture and cigarette smoke. Confirmed to cause various health problems, and classified as a Group 1 human carcinogen by WHO.

          p.card-text
            | Cage molecule acts as a "molecular prison" to capture and trap formaldehyde molecules. Each cage molecule can capture 9 formaledhyde molecules, which is 500 times higher than that captured by activated carbon, the most commonly used material for formaldehyde removal.

          p.card-text
            | Based on the same mechanism, by tuning the size or functionality of the cage molecules, we can develop new materials that capture/detect other emerging indoor pollutants, such as radon (causing lung cancer) or acetaldehyde (one main toxin in smoking).
